# Part 1: Data Overview

The following example makes use of [Illumina Platinum Genomes](http://www.illumina.com/platinumgenomes/).  For more detail about how this data was loaded into the Google Genomics API, please see [Google Genomics Public Data](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/data/platinum-genomes).

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
######################[ CHANGE ME ]##################################
# This codelab assumes that the current working directory is where the Rmd file resides.
setwd("/YOUR/PATH/TO/codelabs/R/PlatinumGenomes-QC")

# Set the Google Cloud Platform project id under which these queries will run.
project <- "YOUR-PROJECT-ID"
#####################################################################
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Set up for BigQuery access.
source("./rHelpers/setup.R")
```

```{r}
# By default this codelab runs upon the Illumina Platinum Genomes Variants.
# Change the table here if you wish to run these queries against a different table.
#tableReplacement <- list("_THE_TABLE_"="genomics-public-data:platinum_genomes.variants")

tableReplacement <- list("_THE_TABLE_"="google.com:biggene:test.pgp_variants_20150205")
```

## Variants

Let's take a look at a few of the [variants within BRCA1 via BigQuery](https://github.com/googlegenomics/getting-started-bigquery/blob/master/RMarkdown/literate-programming-demo.md#data-visualization):
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
result <- DisplayAndDispatchQuery("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlegenomics/getting-started-bigquery/master/sql/variant-level-data-for-brca1.sql",
                                  project=project,
                                  replacements=tableReplacement)
```
Number of rows returned by this query: `r nrow(result)`.

Displaying the first few rows of the dataframe of results:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, results="asis"}
print(xtable(head(result)), type="html", include.rownames=F)
```

## Non-Variant Segments
The source Platinum Genomes data loaded into the Google Genomics API was in [genome VCF](https://sites.google.com/site/gvcftools/home/about-gvcf/gvcf-conventions) (gVCF) format.

Let's take a look at a few non-variant segments within BRCA1:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
result <- DisplayAndDispatchQuery("./sql/non-variant-segments.sql",
                                  project=project,
                                  replacements=tableReplacement)
```
Number of rows returned by this query: `r nrow(result)`.

Displaying the first few rows of the dataframe of results:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, results="asis"}
print(xtable(head(result)), type="html", include.rownames=F)
```
So for any analyses that require us to know for example _"how many samples do and do not have a particular SNP?"_, we'll need to make sure that the non-variant segments are considered in addition to the variants.

Note that Complete Genomics data also includes non-variant segments and requires the same consideration.

## Alternative Allele Field

And then let's take a look at the domain and range of values for alternate_bases:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
result <- DisplayAndDispatchQuery("./sql/characterize-alts.sql",
                                  project=project,
                                  replacements=tableReplacement)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, results="asis"}
print(xtable(result), type="html", include.rownames=F)
```
We see from the query results that there are no special charaters in alternate_bases and the maximum length is ~50 base pairs.

## Genotype Field

And finally let's take a look at the domain and range of values for genotype:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
result <- DisplayAndDispatchQuery("./sql/genotypes-brca1.sql",
                                  project=project,
                                  replacements=tableReplacement)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, results="asis"}
print(xtable(result), type="html", include.rownames=F)
```
We see from the query results the variety of genotypes within BRCA1.

# Summary

To summarize attributes of this particular dataset that we need to consider when working with Platinum Genomes data:
* It has non-variant segments which adds complexity above and beyond [similar examples for the 1,000 Genomes dataset](https://github.com/googlegenomics/bigquery-examples/blob/master/1000genomes/sql/README.md).
* It is comprised only of SNPs and INDELs (contains no structural variants).
* The values for `alternate_bases` are just comprised of the letters A,C,G,T (e.g., contains no `<DEL>` values).
* It contains some single-allele and 1/2 genotypes.
